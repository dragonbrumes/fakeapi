<p> </p> <p><strong>When asked about what shocked him the most about what’s going on after noting that, despite not being Maltese, he clearly was informed and following local news, he responded “I just worry, is the whole system corrupt in Malta or is it not? Is it a mafia state or is it not? That’s my worry.”</strong></p> <p>Rory explained that he was deeply moved by Caruana Galizia’s story, even hoping to find some sort of tour of Daphne’s life and her place of birth, saying that this would promote her cause worldwide.</p> <p>He and his wife even went to the Mosta church in an attempt to visit her burial site, but soon discovered that just her funeral was held there.</p> <p>A protest was held yesterday against the government’s handling of the turmoil that resulted from the Vitals scandal. During the demonstration, hundreds of people chanted “kellha raġun” (she was right) while holding up photos of the assassinated journalist.</p> <p><strong>Do you think that tours in Daphne’s name should be organised to raise more awareness on her important story?</strong></p> <p>•</p> "
